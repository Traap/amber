  \item[AMBER-IUR-001] As the designer, I want to demonstrate Amber can process
    Test Plans, Test Suites, and Test Cases so that I can produce a testing
    report.

  \item[AMBER-IUR-002] As the designer, I want to demonstrate Amber can invoke
    an another executable program so that I can collect evidence for my test
    reports.

  \item[AMBER-IUR-003] As the designer, I want to demonstrate Amber can accept
    command line options so that I can control the type of testing Amber
    conducts.

  \item[AMBER-IUR-004] As the designer, I want to demonstrate Amber can support
    nested Test Suites and Test Cases so that test objects can be logically
    organized.

  \item[AMBER-IUR-005] As the designer, I want to demonstrate Amber can
    substitute keywords when processing YAML files so that the maintenance of
    Test Plans, Test Suites, and Test Cases is minimized.

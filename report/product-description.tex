Amber is a Ruby gem that is used to coordinate automated testing. Amber was
designed to automate various types of testing that require creating and
assembling detailed records intended to prove a product or tool has been tested
for its intended purpose. Amber borrows from a Ruby-on-Rails concept of
convention over configuration. In this regard, Amber consumes YAML documents
that are placed beneath a factory directory root. You are encouraged to review
Amber's report directory because it has been designed to demonstrate Amber's
capabilities. Amber.pdf has been provided to demonstrate the automation
framework components Amber, autodoc, docbld, and tlc-article.

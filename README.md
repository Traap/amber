### Automated testing 
**amber** is a Ruby gem that is used to coordinate automated testing.  **amber**
was designed to automation various types of testing that require creating and
assembling detailed records intended to prove a product or tool has been tested
for its intended purpose.  **amber** borrows from a Ruby-on-Rails concept of
convention over configuration.  In this regard, amber consumes YAML documents
that are placed beneath a factory directory root.  You are encouraged to review
**amber's** report directory because it has been designed to demonstrate
**amber's** capabilities.
[example.pdf](https://github.com/Traap/amber/blob/master/doc/example.pdf) has
been provided to demonstrate the automation framework components amber,
[autodoc](https://github.com/Traap/autodoc),
[docbld](https://github.com/Traap/docbld), and

##### LaTeX macros
test plan output (tpo), test suite output (tso), and test case output (tco) are
LaTeX macros [autodoc](https://bitbucket-vial.intra.fresenius.com/scm/soup/autodoc.git) uses to assemble output
from amber into a report.

Refer to [autodoc](https://bitbucket-vial.intra.fresenius.com/scm/soup/autodoc.git) to learn how an external
program interacts with amber. amber **must** create an output factory containing files to have them automatically
consumed.

##### Console output
amber captures status, system out, and system error and records the results
to a-test-case.tex file.  

##### Step files
amber records PASS or FAIL for each Test Step.  The result is determined by
the program that amber runs.

##### png files
Any custom program amber invokes can take a screen capture and record them 
as test-output/factory/case/a-test-case/a-test-case-001.png.  Multiple png 
files are supported.

##### csv files
Any custom program amber invokes can record CSV files as
test-output/factory/case/a-test-case/a-test-case-001.csv.  Multiple csv 
files are supported.

#### General
##### --help
Show this message.

1.3.192 is this the current version.

#### --verbose
Log the commands what will be run when --nodryrun is used.  **NOTE:** This
option write nurfed because amber writes the commands to the test output
factory.  This occurs because amber is capturing standard input, standard
output, and standard error.  Amber conditionally writes either standard output
or standard error to the test output factor based on the exit status of the
program ran.

#### Input Factory
##### --plan
A comma-separated list of test plan names amber is to process.  The following
directory and YAML file name convention is mandatory:
factory/plan/a-plan/a-a-plan.YAML.

##### --suite
A comma-separated list of test suite names amber is to process.  The
following directory and YAML file name convention is mandatory:
factory/suite/a-suite/a-suite.YAML.

##### --case
A comma-separated list of test case names amber is to process.  The
following directory and YAML file name convention is mandatory:
factory/case/suite/a-case/a-case.YAML.

##### --file
A comma-separated list of file names amber is to process.

#### Substitution
##### --browser
amber uses Chrome by default.  Your Test Plan, Test Suite, and Test Case
must be written to reference a program that uses Web test driver.

##### --language
amber uses english(en) by default.  Your Test Plan, Test Suite, and Test Case must be
written to reference a program the requires internationalization and
localization.

#### Output Factory
##### --nodryrun
By default, amber does not have side effects when run.  You must explicitly
use the **--nodryrun** options to cause side effects.  The commands that would
have been executed are echoed to system out.

##### --simulate
The Simulate option is used to create a Test Output directory so that you can
design your report.  Each command defined in your Test Case YAML file **echo**
echoed to the Test Output directory Test Case file.

##### --obliterate
The Test Output directory is obliterated before running any Tests.

##### --environment
A list of environment variables amber records in the output factory.  See
[environment.rb](https://bitbucket-vial.intra.fresenius.com/projects/SOUP/repos/amber/browse/lib/amber/environment.rb)
for a complete listing of files.

### Add these functions to .bashrc
```bash

export AMBERPATH

function newfactoryitem() {
  ${AMBERPATH}/bin/newfactoryitem $@
}

function check-test-output() {
  echo grep -rw --include=\s*.* test-output/ -e $1

function pass() {
  check-test-output PASS
}

function fail() {
  check-test-output FAIL
}

function requirements() {
  echo grep -rw --include=\*.yaml factory/ -e 'requirement:' 
  grep -rw --include=\*.yaml factory/ -e 'requirement:'

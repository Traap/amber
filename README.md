### Automated testing 
**amber** is a Ruby gem that is used automated testing.  **amber** was designed
to automation various types of testing that require creating and assembling
detailed records intended to prove a product or tool has been tested for its
intended purpose.  **amber** borrows from a Ruby-on-Rails concept of convention
over configuration.  In this regard, amber consumes YAML documents that are
placed beneath a factory directory root.  You are encouraged to review
**amber's** report directory because it has been designed to demonstrate
**amber's** capabilities.  [example.pdf](https://github.com/Traap/amber/blob/master/doc/example.pdf) 
has been provided to demonstrates the automation framework components amber,
[autodoc](https://github.com/Traap/autodoc),
[docbld](https://github.com/Traap/docbld), and
[tlc-article](https://github.com/Traap/tlc-article).

```
### Output Factory
#### Generated by amber
```bash
../test-output/factory
../test-output/factory/plan
../test-output/factory/plan/a-plan-name/a-plan-name.tex

../test-output/factory/suite
../test-output/factory/suite/a-suite-name/a-suite-name.tex

../test-output/factory/case
../test-output/factory/case/a-test-case/a-test-case.tex

../test-output/factory/case/a-test-case/step-002.tex
../test-output/factory/case/a-test-case/step-003.tex
```

##### Console output
**amber** captures status, system out, and system error and records the results
to a-test-case.tex file.  

##### Step files
**amber** records PASS or FAIL for each Test Step.  The result is determined by
the program that **amber** runs.

##### png files
Any custom program **amber** invokes can take a screen capture and record them 
as test-output/factory/case/a-test-case/a-test-case-001.png  Multiple png 
files are supported.

##### csv files
Any custom program **amber** invokes can record CSV files as
test-output/factory/case/a-test-case/a-test-case-001.csv.  Multiple csv 
files are supported.

#### General
##### --help
Show this message.

##### --version
1.0.144 is this the current version.

#### --verbose
Log the commands what will be run when --nodryrun is used.  **NOTE:** This
option write nurfed because amber writes the commands to the test output
factory.  This occurs because amber is capturing standard input, standard
output, and standard error.  Amber conditionally writes either standard output
or standard error to the test output factor based on the exit status of the
program ran.

#### Input Factory
##### --plan
A comma-separated list of test plan names **amber** is to process.  The following
directory and YAML file name convention is mandatory:
factory/plan/a-plan/a-aplan.YAML.

##### --suite
A comma-separated list of test suite names **amber** is to process.  The
following directory and YAML file name convention is mandatory:
factory/suite/a-suite/a-suite.YAML.

##### --case
A comma-separated list of test case names **amber** is to process.  The
following directory and YAML file name convention is mandatory:
factory/case/suite/a-case/a-case.YAML.

##### --file
A comma-separated list of file names **amber** is to process.

#### Substitution
##### --browser
**amber** uses Chrome by default.  Your Test Plan, Test Suite, and Test Case
must be written to reference a program that uses Web test driver.

##### --language
**amber** uses en by default.  Your Test Plan, Test Suite, and Test Case must be
written to reference a program the requires internationalization and
localization.

#### Output Factory
##### --nodryrun
By default, **amber** does not have side-effects when run.  You must explicitly
use the **--nodryrun** options to cause side effects.  The commands that would
have been executed are echoed to system out.

##### --environment
A list of environment variables **amber** records in the output factory.  See
[environment.rb](https://github.com/Traap/amber/blob/master/lib/amber/environment.rb) for a complete listing of files.

### Add these function to .bashrc
```bash
AMBERPATH=${HOME}/git/amber
export AMBERPATH

function newfactoryitem() {
  ${AMBERPATH}/bin/newfactoryitem $@
}

function check-test-output() {
  echo grep -rw --include=\s*.* test-output/ -e $1
  grep -rw --include=\s*.* test-output/ -e $1
}

function pass() {
  check-test-output PASS
}

function fail() {
  check-test-output FAIL
}
```

### Project Management
The **amber** repository uses a SCRUM framework adapted to standard GitHub
tooling.  **amber** is integrated with Travis-ci.org for continuous
integration and AllanConsulting.slack.com for centralized notification.
